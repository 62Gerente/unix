perltidy for Sublime Text 2/3
=============================

Version: 0.4.0

What's new?
-----------

* Sublime Text 3 support added.

* Default key binding for OS X changed from `Command+Shift+t` to
  `Control+Shift+t`, the former fires a terminal.

* Default perltidy options changed. PerlTidy will now use a set of perltidy
  options, as suggested by Damian Conway's Perl Best Practices (PBP).

* Options found in perltidyrc files will now override default/user options.
  The former processing of perltidy options was counter-intuitive. Old
  behavior can be restored by setting "perltidy_options_take_precedence" to
  "true" in user settings.
