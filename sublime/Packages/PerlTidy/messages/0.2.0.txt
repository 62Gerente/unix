perltidy for Sublime Text 2
===========================

Version: 0.2.0

What's new?
-----------

* Support for Cygwin added.

* Automatic detection of Strawberry Perl, ActivePerl and Cygwin under Windows
  added.

* User setting "perltidy_options_take_precedence" added. If set to "true",
  which is the default, options from user setting "perltidy_options" will take
  precedence over options found in perltidyrc files. Set to "false" to reverse
  this behavior and let perltidyrc files win.
