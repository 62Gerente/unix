perltidy for Sublime Text 2/3
=============================

Version: 0.4.2

Thanks for installing PerlTidy! Below are some quick notes to get you started.
Please refer to:

    https://github.com/vifo/SublimePerlTidy

for full documentation.

Quick start
-----------

To reformat Perl source code with PerlTidy, open your Perl file of choice and
hit `Control+Shift+t`.

PerlTidy will try to find your perltidy installation by looking at your PATH
environment variable and in addition by searching for perltidy in default
installation locations.

Should this automatic detection fail, please inspect any error output on the
Sublime Text console and adjust user setting "perltidy_cmd" as described in
the full documentation.

Thank You.
